Tersus

An achingly simple Tumblr theme without the usual cruft.

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

Tersus for Tumblr is an exercise in publishing template
minimalism, based on the orginal Tersus for Wordpress theme.

Why create yet another theme? As clean and stripped down as
some themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally called Simplicity, a name that was
suggested prior to the discovery of a WordPress theme
already using that name. After a brief discussion, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus
(which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the
bill rather nicely ... and here we are.

To view a recent version of Tersus for Tumblr in action,
head on over to the official tumblelog:
