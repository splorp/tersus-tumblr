# Tersus

An achingly simple Tumblr theme without all the usual cruft.


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism, based on the orginal [Tersus for Wordpress](http://github.com/splorp/tersus/) theme.

Why create yet another theme? As clean and stripped down as some themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally named Simplicity — a term that described exactly what the project was all about. However, that was prior to the discovery of a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme already using that very name. After a brief discussion, several latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus (which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the bill rather nicely … and here we are.

Keep track of Tersus development on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tersustheme).
